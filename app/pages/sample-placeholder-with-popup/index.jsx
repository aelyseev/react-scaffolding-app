                    The topography of a country is to some extent a prophecy of its future. Had there been no Mississippi coursing for three
                    thousand miles through the North American Continent, no Ohio and Missouri bisecting it from east to west, no great
                    inland seas indenting and watering it, no fertile prairies stretching across its vast areas, how different would have

                    Russia is the strange product of strange physical conditions. Nature was not in impetuous mood when she created this

                    have been just a cold-blooded experiment in subjecting a vast region to the most rigorous and least generous conditions
                    possible, leaving it unshielded alike from Polar winds in winter or scorching heat in summer, divesting it of beauty and
                    of charm, and then casting this arid, frigid, torpid land to a branch[â€¦]
