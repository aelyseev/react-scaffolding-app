                In speaking of this eastern half of Europe as Russia, we have been borrowing from the future. At the time we have been
                considering there was no Russia. The world into which Christ came contained no Russia. The Roman Empire rose and fell, and
                still there was no Russia. Spain, Italy, France, and England were taking on a new form of life through the infusion of
                Teuton strength, and modern Europe was coming into being, and still the very name of Russia did not exist. The great expanse
                of plains, with its medley of Oriental barbarism, was to Europe the obscure region through which had come the Hunnish
                invasion from Asia.
